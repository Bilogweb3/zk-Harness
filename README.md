<h1 align="center">zk-Harness</h1>

zk-Harness is a benchmarking framework for *zero knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zkSNARKs)*. 
This repository contains a modular and easily extensible framework for benchmarking zkSNARKs and underlying mathematical primitives.

## üìä Benchmark Results

The benchmark results are currently hosted at [zk-bench.org](https://www.zk-bench.org).

The backend for mathematical operations has been merged with [zka.lc](https://zka.lc/).

### Currently Supported Standard Payloads 

The current framework supports a set of payloads for each library.
We aim to successively extend the following once more circuits are available as `std` in the respective libraries.

|          | Exponentiate       | SHA-256           |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `Bellman`| :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:|
| `Circom` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:|
| `Gnark`  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:|
| `Halo2`  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:|
| `Starky` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:|

### Run Benchmarks On Your Own!

zk-Harness is supposed to be easily extensible and modular, which means that you should be able to integrate you own circuits with ease.
Each framework in `framework/<framework_name>` includes a detailed description on how to add a self-developed circuit that goes beyond the standard payloads already integrated.

To validate and re-run any of the standard payloads, please refer to the the `Makefile`, which utilizes standard configuration files.

Many end-to-end applications require proving a specific cryptographic primitive,
which requires the specification of said cryptographic primitive in a specific ZKP
framework.

- *Circuits for native field operations* -  These operations, namely, addition and multiplication in F_p, are supported by each SNARK library, and they are the most efficient to prove with a SNARK because arithmetic modulo F_p is the native computation model of a SNARK. This provides a good understanding of the efficiency of the core
SNARK implementation.
- *Circuits for non-native field operations* - All computations we want to prove do not belong to arithmetic modulo p. For instance, Z_{2^64} or uint64/int64 is a popular data type in traditional programming languages. Or, we might want to prove arithmetic on a different field, say Z_q. This usually happens when we want to verify elliptic-curve based cryptographic primitives. An example of this is supporting verification of ECDSA signatures. The native field of elliptic curve underlying the chosen SNARK typically differs from the base field of the secp256k1 curve
- *Circuits for SNARK-optimized primitives* - One of the challenges in the practically using SNARKs is their inefficiency with regard to traditional hash algorithms, like SHA-2, and traditional signature algorithms, such as ECDSA. They are fast when executed on a CPU, but prohibitively slow when used in a SNARK. As a result, the community has proposed several hash functions and signature algorithms that are SNARK-friendly, such as the following:
  - Poseidon Hash
  - Pedersen Hash
  - MIMC Hash
  - Ed25519 (EdDSA signature)
- *Circuits for CPU-optimized primitives* - Even though it would be beneficial to only rely on SNARK optimized primitives, practical applications often don‚Äôt allow for the usage of e.g. Poseidon hash functions or SNARK friendly signature schemes. For example, verifying ECDSA signatures in SNARKs is crucial when building e.g. zkBridge, however an implementation requires for non-native field arithmetic, and therefore yields many constraints. Similarly, for building applications such as TLS Notary, one has to prove SHA-256 hash functions and AES-128 encryption which yields many constraints. Hence, we intend to benchmark the performance of the following cryptographic primitives and their
circuit implementations in different ZKP-frameworks:
  - SHA-256
  - Blake2
  - ECDSA

### Current Features

On a high level, zk-Harness takes as input a configuration file. The ‚ÄúConfig Reader‚Äù reads the standardized config and invokes the ZKP framework as specified in the configuration file. You can find a description of the configuration file in the tutorials/config sub-folder of the GitHub repository. Each integrated ZKP framework exposes a set of functions that take as an input the standardized configuration parameters to execute the corresponding benchmarks. The output of benchmarking a given ZKP framework is a log file in csv format with standardized metrics. The log file is read by the ‚ÄúLog Analyzer‚Äù, which compiles the logs into pandas dataframes that are used by the front-end and displayed on the public website. You can find the standardized logging format in the tutorials/logs sub-folder.

Currently, zk-Harness includes the following components as a starting point:

| Benchmarks                         | Field Arithmetic  | Elliptic Curve Group Operations | Circuit Implementations |
|------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| gnark                              | X                | X                              | X                       |
| circom / snarkjs                   | X                | X                              | X                       |
| arkworks                           | X                | X                              |                         |

We aim to successively expand this list to further include benchmarks for other ZKP frameworks, recursion and zk-EVMs. As a part of the ZKP/Web3 Hackathon hosted by UC Berkeley RDI, we aim to further develop the frameworks integrated into zk-Harness. You can find the program description detailing future integrations [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Igm47dFXSOFAC_wldfUG4Y9OiITqlbQu/view). A detailed list of currently included sub-components and the framework architecture can be found in the [GitHub](https://github.com/zkCollective/zk-Harness) repository.

### How to add new frameworks to the Nix environment

The `./flake.nix` file contains the Nix code which constructs the Nix environment. To integrate a new
framework into the Nix environment, this code must be changed so that it adds to the environment all
of the dependencies required to run the new framework-specific benchmark commands in the Makefile.
In general, the following steps will be involved:

 * Nix the framework, if it has not already been Nixed.
 * Add the Nixed framework to the flake `inputs`.
 * Add the framework output to the `devShells.default.packages` in the flake `outputs`.
 * Add any other dependencies needed to run the benchmarks to the `devShells.default.packages` in the flake `outputs`.
 * Add any necessary setup code to the `devShells.default.shellHook`.

A few things to note:

 * Nix packages are supposed to have reproducible builds, and there are restrictions within the Nix build system designed to rule out common causes of non-reproducibility. Therefore, a build process designed to work outside Nix may not work within Nix without modification.
    * In particular, the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) does not apply in Nix; for instance, `/usr/bin/bash` cannot be expected to point to anything in the Nix environment. Instead of `/usr/bin/foo`, use `/usr/bin/env foo`.
 * Nix is a Turing complete programming language, and there cannot be a set recipe for Nixing software, since every software package is different.
 * Although Nix builds are in theory reproducible, the way this benchmark suite is set up does not run the benchmarks within Nix. In theory, running the benchmarks within the Nix environment should produce similar results on similar machines. However, since the benchmarks are not being run in a hermetic Nix environment, the benchmarks may work on your machine and not work at all on another machine of the same architecture, due to differences in software configuration. To avoid this, you should make sure that the commands in your Makefile only invoke dependencies that are in the Nix environment.

Here are some hopefully useful pointers for Nixing pre-existing code bases:

 * [cargo2nix](https://github.com/cargo2nix/cargo2nix) for Nixing Rust projects;
 * [Nixing Go projects](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Go);
 * The Nix environment for this project contains Python and Node.js, and you can incorporate
   Node and Python dependencies by adding them to the `./requirements.txt` or `./package.json`
   file (as applicable).
 * You can learn more about Nix by reading the [Nix pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/)
   and referring to the [Nix reference manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/).
